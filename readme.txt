This project is divided into three folders:
  - generate-permutations: algorithm to generate the instances used in the experiments
  - inversion-algorithms: algorithms for lambda-permutations based on the concept of invertions
  - breakpoint-algorithms: algorithms for lambda-permutations on the concept of breakpoint

The algorithms are implemented in C++ using the builder CMake, except for generate-permutations which has individual cpp files.
